A crossover operator in `moors` is any type that implements the {{ docs_rs("trait", "operators.crossover.CrossoverOperator") }} trait. For example:

```rust
use ndarray::{Array1, Axis, concatenate, s};
use crate::operators::CrossoverOperator;
use crate::random::RandomGenerator;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
/// Single-point crossover operator for binary-encoded individuals.
pub struct SinglePointBinaryCrossover;

impl CrossoverOperator for SinglePointBinaryCrossover {
    fn crossover(
        &self,
        parent_a: &Array1<f64>,
        parent_b: &Array1<f64>,
        rng: &mut impl RandomGenerator,
    ) -> (Array1<f64>, Array1<f64>) {
        let num_genes = parent_a.len();
        // Select a crossover point between 1 and num_genes - 1
        let crossover_point = rng.gen_range_usize(1, num_genes);
        // Split parents at the crossover point and create offspring
        let offspring_a = concatenate![
            Axis(0),
            parent_a.slice(s![..crossover_point]),
            parent_b.slice(s![crossover_point..])
        ];
        let offspring_b = concatenate![
            Axis(0),
            parent_b.slice(s![..crossover_point]),
            parent_a.slice(s![crossover_point..])
        ];
        (offspring_a, offspring_b)
    }
}
```

The main method to implement is `crossover`, which takes two parents (`ndarray::Array1`) and produces two offspring. Predefined crossover operators include:
